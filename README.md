# showcase_AI_Editor
This is ShowCase AI Editor which takes videos as inputs and extracts transcripts from them.
The transcripts are then integrated with their respective timestamps (word to word).
Then the required transcript is selected instead of cropping videos manually.
the selected tokens are then combined and stitched to form a combined cropped video.
